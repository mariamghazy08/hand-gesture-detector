Communication for people with hearing disabilities can be challenging, 
especially in environments where sign language is not commonly understood. 
This project aims to bridge the communication gap by translating sign language 
gestures into text.
Our idea is Hand Gesture detection System is designed to recognize specific 
hand gestures using a camera module and display corresponding text on an LCD 
screen while providing audio feedback using speakers. The system is 
implemented on a Raspberry Pi with Python and integrates MediaPipe for hand 
tracking and gesture detection
